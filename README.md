# Conversation_Sentiment_Analysis
Final Project for Machine Learning : By Kaivan Khazeni and Sahith Jampala

This repository contains the files for the Conversation Sentiment Project

The files are a

Model.py where we implement the Naive Bayes classifer and run error testing

Topic Analysis.py where we run the algorithm to label sentiment of a sentence
based off of topic classification. In this file, we do topic classification as well.

Data Processing.py where we clean the data and get the correct dataframes for several different methods that we run


In the main file, we have our code commented out and if you desire to run the code,
please uncomment the code and run.
